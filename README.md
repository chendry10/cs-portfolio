# CS Portfolio

Welcome to my Computer Science portfolio! This repository contains a collection of my programming projects, showcasing my skills in Python, artificial intelligence, game development, and more.

## Projects

### 1. Flappy Bird AI
**Location:** `Flappy Bird/src`

A Python implementation of Flappy Bird with an AI agent that learns to play the game using a neural network and genetic algorithm. The project uses Pygame for graphics and Numpy for neural network operations.

- **Features:**
  - AI-controlled bird learns to play Flappy Bird autonomously.
  - Neural network and genetic algorithm for evolving gameplay strategies.
  - Visual and headless (fast) training modes.
- **How to Run:**
  1. Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
  2. Run the game:
     ```bash
     python Flappy Bird/src/flappy_ai.py
     ```
- **Requirements:** Python 3.7+, Pygame, Numpy
